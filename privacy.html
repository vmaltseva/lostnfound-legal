  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <small>Effective date: 2025-08-14</small>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Lost &amp; Found Movie</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) processes personal data when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>What data we process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Country inferred from IP (approximate location)</strong> — used to show streaming availability for your region.</li>
    <li><strong>Display name (optional)</strong> — shown in the UI only; you can change or clear it at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Movie likes/favorites</strong> — stored so you can revisit and manage your picks.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (e.g., crash reports) — used to fix bugs and improve stability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect email, phone number, precise GPS location, or payment information. We do not show ads and do not sell your data.</p>

  <h2>Why we process data (legal bases)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: infer country from IP, fetch images/metadata (TMDB CDN), and collect diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Contract</strong>: store likes/favorites to provide core functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong>: if you choose to enter a display name, we process it to personalize the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How long we keep data</h2>
  <p>We keep your data for as long as necessary to provide the service or until you request deletion. You can reset likes and clear your display name from Settings → Legal → <em>Delete my data</em>, or by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>Sharing and service providers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> — hosting, database, and crash reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>TMDB</strong> — images and movie metadata are loaded from TMDB's CDN/API.</li>
    <li><strong>JustWatch</strong> — we link to streaming availability pages; when you follow a link, your IP may be visible to that service.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not share your data with advertisers. We use processors only to operate the app.</p>

  <h2>International transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be processed on servers outside your country. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) with our processors.</p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data, and to object to certain processing. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@lostnfoundmovie.com">support@lostnfoundmovie.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not intended for children under 13 (or the age required by your local law). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the new version here and update the effective date.</p>
